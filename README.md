* Don't hesitate to seek helps with issue workspace

## Assignment 1 - Basic Character Animation

In this assignment, you will learn the basic data structure and animation creation pipeline and are required to create an animation clip with provided infrastructure. Also, you need to understand the mathematics in FK and IK to read the motion capture files and play with them.

Details: [[subfolder](./assignment_1)]

#### Tutorial Slides

TBA

#### Assessments

- A rendered video with character animation (Task 1, 40%)
- Core code implementation of Forward Kinematics (Task 2, 50%)
- Core code implementation of Inverse Kinematics - CCD IK (Task 3, Bonus)
- Report (10%)

## Assignment 2 - Animation Processing and Scripting

This assignment will teach you how to play with animation data by different algorithms like the interpolation, DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) and a Motion Matching.
